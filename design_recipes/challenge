As a user
So that I can keep track of my music listening
I want to add tracks I've listened to and see a list of them.


## 2.

class MusicTracker
    def initialize
        list_of_music_tracks = [] # initializing a list to be used for the tracks
    end

    def add(music_track) # music_track is a string representing the track's title
        list_of_music_tracks << music_track # music_track is assigned to the list
    end

    def show(list_of_music_tracks) # the music list
        return list_of_music_tracks # the list will be returned to the user to see
    end

```ruby
# 1
musicTracker = MusicTracker.new
musicTracker.list_of_music_tracks # => []

# 2
musicTracker = MusicTracker.new
musicTracker.add("Hell Bells")
musicTracker.add("Chase The Ace")
musicTracker.add("Thunderstruck")
musicTracker.list_of_music_tracks # => ["Hell Bells"]
musicTracker.list_of_music_tracks # => "Hell Bells", "Chase The Ace", "Thunderstruck"
```
